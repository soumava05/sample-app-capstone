# Todo App (Java + Spring Boot + Thymeleaf)

A production-grade sample Todo application with:

- User management (register + login)
- User-specific task visibility
- Date-based task planning
- Planned finish date tracking
- Local file-system persistence (no database)

## Tech Stack

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.3.x
- Spring Security
- Spring MVC + Thymeleaf (backend + frontend)
- Jackson (JSON file persistence)
- Maven

## Features

- Secure registration and login (BCrypt password hashing)
- Each user has a private task list
- Add tasks with:
	- Task date
	- Planned finish date
- Mark tasks as completed
- Clean layered architecture:
	- Controller
	- Service
	- Repository
	- Storage utility

## File-Based Persistence

Runtime data is stored under `storage/`:

- `storage/users.json` for user data
- `storage/tasks/<username>.json` for user-wise tasks

The folder is generated automatically at runtime and is excluded in `.gitignore`.

## Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 installed
- Maven 3.9+ installed

### Windows Environment Setup

If Java or Maven is installed but commands are not recognized, set user environment variables once.

PowerShell:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('JAVA_HOME', 'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21.0.10', 'User')
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('MAVEN_HOME', 'C:\Users\SoumavaSamanta\apache-maven-3.9.16', 'User')

$userPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path', 'User')
$entries = ($userPath -split ';' | Where-Object { $_ -and $_.Trim() -ne '' })
if ($entries -notcontains 'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21.0.10\bin') {
	$entries += 'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21.0.10\bin'
}
if ($entries -notcontains 'C:\Users\SoumavaSamanta\apache-maven-3.9.16\bin') {
	$entries += 'C:\Users\SoumavaSamanta\apache-maven-3.9.16\bin'
}
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('Path', ($entries -join ';'), 'User')
```

Close and reopen terminal after this step.

1. Build the application:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

3. Open:

`http://localhost:8080`

### Troubleshooting (Windows)

If `mvn` still fails in an old terminal session, use:

```powershell
& 'C:\Users\SoumavaSamanta\apache-maven-3.9.16\bin\mvn.cmd' spring-boot:run
```

## Test

```bash
mvn test
```

## Design Principles and Standards

### Core Principles

- Follow SOLID, especially:
	- Single Responsibility Principle across controller/service/repository/storage layers
	- Dependency Inversion Principle through interface-driven service and repository design
- Keep separation of concerns strict between web, business, and persistence layers.
- Prefer small, cohesive classes and intention-revealing methods.

### Design Patterns Used

- Repository Pattern for persistence abstraction.
- Service Layer Pattern for business workflows.
- DTO Pattern for form binding and validation boundaries.
- Configuration Pattern for framework wiring under `config` classes.

### Coding Standards

- Constructor injection over field injection.
- Validation at DTO level and business-rule checks at service level.
- Avoid leaking file I/O concerns outside repository/storage components.
- Keep user data isolation strict (no cross-user task access).
- Do not add database dependencies unless explicitly required.

### Testing Standards

- Use behavior-focused tests with Arrange-Act-Assert structure.
- Add or update tests in the same change when behavior is modified.
- Keep tests deterministic and independent.

## Sample Workflow

1. Register a new user
2. Login
3. Add task with task date and planned finish date
4. See only your own tasks
5. Mark task as completed
